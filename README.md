# Power-Press Machine Safety Automation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on safety automation for power-press machines in India.  
It leverages Python for data analysis and automation logic to study workplace injury cases and explore strategies to improve industrial safety standards. The project aims to identify common causes of injuries and suggest automated measures to mitigate risks in manufacturing environments.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical injury data related to power-press machines.
- Identify key risk factors contributing to workplace accidents.
- Implement automation logic to enhance machine safety.
- Provide recommendations for improving industrial safety compliance.

## Dataset
The project uses datasets containing information on workplace injuries, including:
- Type of injury
- Severity of injury
- Cause of accident
- Machine details
- Location and date of incident

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and inconsistent data.
   - Standardize categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis.
   - Visualization of trends, patterns, and outliers.
3. **Automation Logic Implementation**  
   - Python-based simulation of safety automation protocols.
   - Risk assessment and alert system for unsafe operations.
4. **Reporting and Insights**  
   - Summarize key findings.
   - Provide actionable recommendations for safety improvements.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook 

## Results
- Identification of high-risk operations and patterns in injuries.
- Simulated automation measures to reduce accident risk.
- Data-driven insights to improve safety standards and industrial protocols.
